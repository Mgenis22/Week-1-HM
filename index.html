 The 5 html I used 2 youtube html, Photo html, background html, and a different html to link an article.
 It was very difficult at first because coding is not my strongest quality but I managed to make it work.
 Down below is my favorite song of the week and this week I also read an Article about how coding has
 Changed over time which I thought was a really intresting read.

    Hello My name is Michelle Genis, I am a 22 year old ollege student that attends Hunter College.
 This will be my second coding class I take at Hunter. I love coding  because it challenges me 
and I love a challenge . I love watching animation  like Spirited Away and Fruit Basket.
 My love for wanting to pursue animation was when I watched 90' kids shows like Hey Arnold
  and As told by Ginger those gave me inspiration to create my own animation and story.
 
   The 5 html I used 2 youtube html, Photo html, background html color, and a different html to link an article.
 It was very difficult at first because coding is not my strongest quality but I managed to make it work.
 Down below is my favorite song of the week and this week I also read an Article about how coding has
 Changed over time which I thought was a really intresting read.
